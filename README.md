# Project Overview

Up-cycling industrial equipment provides a sustainable way to reuse highly reliable components. Mobile-network cell-tower gear is built for 24 √ó 7 operation in harsh environments, so it is compact, efficient and remarkably resilient.

This project centres on the **Huawei R4875G1 48 V Rectifier Module**. Designed to power base-station loads and battery banks, it can be trimmed from 45 V to 58 V and happily tolerates a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù AC generator or weak grid. The module is **97 % efficient**, delivers up to **4 kW**, includes short-circuit and surge protection, speaks **CAN bus**, and boasts an MTBF of **500 000 h**. It supports dynamic current control plus hibernate/wake-up functions (In hibernate R4875G1's sensors report normally, is silent, uses less than 3W, no high-current relais required).

The ESPHome firmware presented here runs on an **ESP32** development board (built-in CAN peripheral) linked to the rectifier through a **VP230 (SN65HVD230) CAN-bus transceiver**.

- Balance phase current **and** duration are adjustable  
- Auto-hibernate once balancing completes  

| Conventional charging | Soft-Charge |
| --- | --- |
| Full current right up to 100 % SOC ‚Üí repeated disconnects | Current tapers, e.g. 25 A ‚Üí 15 A ‚Üí 10 A ‚Üí 2 A |
| Cells get only minutes of balance time | Final stage at e.g. 0.5 A for up to 300 min |

## Use Cases

Ideal for 15 s/16 s LiFePO‚ÇÑ and 14 s NMC home battery systems, generator-backed solar, fast e-bike charging, marine DC systems and even clean-supply HAM-radio amplifiers. [Turn your ESS into a double conversion UPS and achieve true zero grid backfeed](https://github.com/mjpalmowski/CAN-BUS-control-R4875G1-with-ESPHome-and-MQTT/discussions/4). Eliminate the need for a transfer switch. [Here is Node-RED flow that modulates R48XX charge power depending on surplus solar power.](https://github.com/mjpalmowski/CAN-BUS-control-R4875G1-with-ESPHome-and-MQTT/discussions/8)

Commercial products such as the **EG4 Chargeverter** are essentially two telecom rectifiers in a box‚Äîthis project offers an open, automation-friendly alternative.
