# Project Overview

Upcycling industrial equipment offers a sustainable approach to reusing highly reliable components. Mobile network operators' cell tower equipment is built to operate 24/7 under harsh conditions, making it compact, efficient, and resilient.

This project focuses on the **Huawei R4875G1 48V Rectifier Module**, originally designed to power cell tower equipment and battery banks with dependable DC power. Essentially, this is a robust battery charger that can be adjusted between 45V and 58V, powered by an unstable grid or a dirty AC generator input. The R4875G1 module boasts a "Name Plate Output" of 4000W and an impressive Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of 500,000 hours. It supports current adjustments, dynamic control, and features hibernation and wake-up functions.

This module is 97% efficient, provides up to 4kW of DC power, and includes short circuit and surge protection, communicating via CAN BUS. These capabilities make it suitable for home battery charging, achieved through reverse-engineering its CAN BUS control.

## Key Features
The ESPHome firmware for this project is built for an ESP32 development board, which natively supports CAN BUS. The ESP32 connects to the R4875G1 via a VP230 CAN-BUS transceiver. Below are the main features:

### Supported Sensors
- **AC Power In**
- **DC Power Out**
- **Grid Frequency**
- **Input Current**
- **Output Voltage**
- **Set Maximum Output Current**
- **Input Grid Voltage**
- **Output Temperature**
- **Output Current**

### Configuration Settings
- **CAN Voltage Set**
- **CAN Amp Set**
- **Fallback Amp Set**
- **Fallback Voltage Set**

### Control Buttons
- **CAN ON Button** (Wake-up feature)
- **CAN OFF Button** (Hibernate feature)
- **Fan Full Speed Button**
- **Fan Auto Mode Button**

### Additional Features
- **Over-temperature Shutdown** (Configurable in YAML, does not require Home Assistant or Node-RED)

## Use Cases
This setup is ideal for charging common 15s and 16s LiFePO4 packs and 14s NMC batteries, making it useful for home battery systems that store solar or off-peak power. It is particularly useful when backing up solar setups with a generator. Additionally, it can serve as a powerful DC bench power supply when paired with a robust adjustable buck/boost converter, or even as an onboard e-bike charger.

For example, the **EG4 Chargeverter** product is essentially two of these 48V telecom units in a single box, with buttons for setting maximum voltage and current. [Watch the Chargeverter Teardown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPEjRtABc2U).

## Hardware Setup

### Module and Connections
The **Huawei R4875G1** power module is controlled as shown below. It can output 35A at 54V continuously at an ambient temperature of 23Â°C without additional cooling.

- **ESP32 WROOM** Development Board
- **VP230** CAN-BUS transceiver Board
- **R4875G1/G5 Board Edge Connector**
- **DC Cables**: 8 AWG silicone-insulated, supporting up to 40A continuously.
- **AC Cables**: Rated for continuous 16A supply.
- **CAN BUS Connections**: White (CAN-L) and Black (CAN-H)

To connect, ensure the TX pin from the ESP32 is connected to the transceiver's TX pin, and the RX pin is connected to the transceiver's RX pin.

## Software Configuration

You can use the **ESPHome** plugin in Home Assistant to create a new device and paste the provided YAML configuration. 
If you prefer a standalone setup, you can configure the web server component for browser based control.

1. **MQTT**: Uncomment the `mqtt:` block if using MQTT.
2. **Home Assistant API**: Uncomment the `api:` block for Home Assistant discovery.
3. **Web Interface**: Uncomment the `webserver:` block if a web interface is needed.

## Pre-compiled `.bin` files are available for direct upload to an ESP32 board if you do not wish to modify the YAML file:
