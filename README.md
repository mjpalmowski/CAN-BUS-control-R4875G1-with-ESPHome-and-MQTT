Up-cycling industrial equipment provides a sustainable way to reuse highly reliable components. Mobile-network cell-tower gear is built for 24 √ó 7 operation in harsh environments, so it is compact, efficient and remarkably resilient.

This project centres on the **Huawei R4875G1 48 V Rectifier Module**. Designed to power base-station loads and battery banks, it can be trimmed from 45 V to 58 V and happily tolerates a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù AC generator or weak grid. The module is **97 % efficient**, delivers up to **4 kW**, includes short-circuit and surge protection, speaks **CAN bus**, and boasts an MTBF of **500 000 h**. 

**A well-designed and powerful battery charger.**

The ESPHome firmware presented here runs on an **ESP32** development board linked to the rectifier through a **VP230 (SN65HVD230) CAN-bus transceiver**.

### üîã Soft-Charge *(balance charging)*
- Charger tapers max current smoothly to avoid high-current BMS trips  
- Balance phase current **and** duration are adjustable  
- Auto-hibernate once balancing completes  

| Conventional charging of an unbalanced pack | Soft-Charge of an unbalanced pack |
| --- | --- |
| Full current right up to 100 % SOC ‚Üí repeated disconnects | Current tapers, e.g. 25 A ‚Üí 15 A ‚Üí 10 A ‚Üí 2 A |
| Cells get only minutes of balance time | Final stage at e.g. 0.5 A for up to 300 min |
| Bad vibes & stress to BMS and Battery | Safely restore pack balance |

The voltages in the "soft-charge" section act as triggers that reduce the charge current when the battery approaches full capacity.

The actual final charge voltage is set here: "10 Set Voltage Limit".

For example, if you set 54.75V as your "Set Voltage Limit", the charger will work towards that voltage at the configured current (12 Set DC Current Limit).

As the output voltage approaches the steep end of the voltage curve, it triggers the "soft-charge" algorithm at the specified voltages to gradually reduce the charge current.

The final trigger also starts a timer, allowing you to define how long the battery should remain in the balancing phase. Once that period has elapsed, the charger switches off.

It is important to note that drawing power from the battery during soft charge is not ideal. While it won‚Äôt damage the battery, it is recommended to disable soft-charge if the battery is in use while charging.

For optimal results, perform soft charging when the battery is not under load.

## Use Cases

Ideal for 15 s/16 s LiFePO‚ÇÑ and 14 s NMC home battery systems, generator-backed solar, fast e-bike charging, marine DC systems and even clean-supply HAM-radio amplifiers. [Turn your ESS into a double conversion UPS and achieve true zero grid backfeed](https://github.com/mjpalmowski/CAN-BUS-control-R4875G1-with-ESPHome-and-MQTT/discussions/4). Eliminate the need for a transfer switch. [Here is Node-RED flow that modulates R48XX charge power depending on surplus solar power.](https://github.com/mjpalmowski/CAN-BUS-control-R4875G1-with-ESPHome-and-MQTT/discussions/8)

Commercial products such as the **EG4 Chargeverter** are essentially two telecom rectifiers in a box‚Äîthis project offers an open, automation-friendly alternative.
