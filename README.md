Upcycling industrial equipment offers a sustainable approach to reusing highly reliable components. Mobile network operators' cell tower equipment is built to operate 24/7 under harsh conditions, making it compact, efficient, and resilient.

This project focuses on the **Huawei R4875G1 48V Rectifier Module**, originally designed to power cell tower equipment and battery banks with dependable DC power. Essentially, this is a robust battery charger that can be adjusted between 45V and 58V, powered by an unstable grid or a dirty AC generator input. The R4875G1 module boasts a "Name Plate Output" of 4000W and an impressive Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of 500,000 hours. It supports current adjustments, dynamic control, and features hibernation and wake-up functions.

This module is 97% efficient, provides up to 4kW of DC power, and includes short circuit and surge protection, communicating via CAN BUS. These capabilities make it suitable for home battery charging, achieved [through reverse-engineering its CAN BUS control.](https://github.com/mjpalmowski/CAN-BUS-control-R4875G1-with-ESPHome-and-MQTT/discussions/4)

## Key Features

## Use Cases
This setup is ideal for charging common 15s and 16s LiFePO4 packs and 14s NMC batteries, making it useful for home battery systems that store solar or off-peak power. It is particularly useful when backing up solar setups with a generator. Additionally, it can serve as a powerful DC bench power supply when paired with a robust [adjustable](https://github.com/mjpalmowski/esphome-juntek-DPM8650-mqtt-http-tool) buck/boost converter, as an onboard fast-charger for boats that encounter different supply voltages or as a rapid charger for Ebikes, [here is a guy that runs his HAM radio amp equippment](https://qsl.net/zl1rs/old/r4875g1.html) with it (clean DC indeed). And for those who want to play along at home, here is a guy that has an innovative approach to use four R4875G1s to create a double conversion system (he is basically planning to run his entire grid import through these rectifiers straight to his batteries, so as far as the grid is concerned he is just using a battery charger, very cool), removing the need for clunky high current relays (changeover switches, ATS), removing the worry about grid backfeed. [His story is unfolding here](https://diysolarforum.com/threads/diy-chargenectifier.56329/page-29#post-1281632).  

For example, the **EG4 Chargeverter** product is essentially two of these 48V telecom units in a box, with buttons for setting maximum voltage and current. [Watch the Chargeverter Teardown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPEjRtABc2U).

So, if you want to build an automation-friendly Chargeverter alternative, you are in the right place.

## Hardware Setup

### Module and Connections
The **Huawei R4875G1** power module is controlled as shown below. It can output 35A at 54V continuously at an ambient temperature of 23Â°C without additional cooling. 

![Screenshot 2024-11-14 111944](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c53ce6c9-9675-487b-8b2c-839d39cd7b22)


PCB edge connectors for the R4875G1 and R4875G5 series are available on AliExpress.

![Designer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c70dea2a-3bfe-4446-9f6f-ea634a3ef5c6)


- **ESP32 WROOM** Development Board
- **VP230** CAN-BUS transceiver Board (SN65HVD230)
- **R4875G1/G5 Board Edge Connector**
- **DC Cables**: 8 AWG silicone-insulated, supporting up to 40A continuously.
- **AC Cables**: Rated for continuous 16A supply.
- **CAN BUS Connections**: White (CAN-L) and Black (CAN-H)

To connect, ensure the TX pin from the ESP32 is connected to the transceiver's TX pin, and the RX pin is connected to the transceiver's RX pin.

**Now, you have it all connected and can't wait to try? Go here [set it up as in the quick start guide for the ready made .bin :)](https://github.com/mjpalmowski/CAN-BUS-control-R4875G1-with-ESPHome-and-MQTT/releases/tag/v0.95)** 

![Wiring Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4670849b-ee3d-4f3b-bfe2-2639171bf4d3)

For those not using the adapter board, the module can be manually turned on by shorting specific pads to DC-minus.


### Important Detail about the Edge Connector/Pins

![Screenshot 2024-11-29 152930](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae93452b-a830-4199-a4b6-3352d014ca55)

Connect the following pins together
Pin1 to Pin5

Connect the following Pins to DC- (Pin1):
11,12

Connect the folowing pins together (this will allow the full 75A max output currrent to be set, see comment about CAN scaling factor below):
Pin9 to Pin10 

- If Pin9 and Pin10 are not connected the CAN message for setting "Current" has a scaling factor of `* 20` and the R4875G can only be set to a maximum of 50A.
  
- If Pin9 is connected to Pin10 the CAN message for setting "Current" has a scaling factor of `* 15` and the 4875G can be stet to a max of 75A.

please adjust the scaling factor in the YAML code if you have not connected Pin9 to Pin10.

1. **MQTT**: Uncomment the `mqtt:` block if using MQTT.
2. **Home Assistant API**: Uncomment the `api:` block for Home Assistant discovery.
3. **Web Interface**: Uncomment the `webserver:` block if a web interface is needed.
